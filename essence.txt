Genetic drift(G) - Loss genetic variation(H)

G is the probability of picking two alles of same type.

G1=(1/(2*N))+(1-1/(2*N))*G

Finite Population size(N), Alleles(2*N)

To add mutation to the mix

mu=Probability of an allele mutating per generation.

G1=((1-mu)^2)*(1/(2*N))+(1-1/(2*N))*G

H1=(1-(1/2*N))*H   +   2*mu*(1-H)

selective neutrality of a single allele formed due to mutation

probability of fixation of this single allele is it's frequency=1/2*N

Monte-carlo simulation

Number of configurations

to the stage of  genetic drift, all variation would be lost.

Chapter 5: 

While simulating the next generation, previously we have assumed that next generation alleles 
would be generated randomly. In reality, this is not true and we have a constraint called space which needs to be considered.

Why do heterozygote density decreases eventually?
Because in the case of both parents being homozygotes, offspring will be homozygote again.. 
But in the case of heterozygotes, offspring can be homo or heterozygotes.

evolution is simply the change in allele frequencies. Natural selection is just one of the forces affecting these allele frequencies

Math of Natural selection:

		A1A1		A1A2		A2A2
Fitness w11			w12			w22
freq(t)	p^2			2*p*q		q^2
freq(t+1)p^2*w11/u	2*p*q*w12/u	q^2*w22/u

	u=p^2*w11+2*p*q*w12+q^2*w22/u;

Direction,balancing and disruptive

balancing - h<0 - high fitness for heterozygosity.

direction - 0<=h<=1 - 

disruptive - h>1 - 

1-h*s

h-talks about heterozygosity.
